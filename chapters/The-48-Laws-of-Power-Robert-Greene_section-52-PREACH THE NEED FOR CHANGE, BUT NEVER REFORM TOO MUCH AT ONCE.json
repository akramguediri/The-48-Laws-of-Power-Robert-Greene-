He illustrates through historical examples, particularly the reign of Thomas Cromwell and Mao Tse-tung, how radical reforms can lead to backlash if not carefully managed. Change must be perceived as an improvement rather than a disruption to the familiar. Leaders seeking to implement change are advised to entwine the new with the old, making reforms feel less threatening. Ultimately, the chapter emphasizes the delicate balance between innovation and stability, calling for strategic, gradual evolution instead of abrupt upheaval.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"A symbolic cat representing habits and comfort, a surreal environment of shifting shadows and light, high-contrast lighting creating tension, a dark color palette of deep greys and blacks with accents of warm tones, emotionally charged, surrealist art style, a textured feel of fabric and fur, unsettling composition suggesting chaos, rich detail conveying psychological depth, angled perspective to evoke discomfort --v 7 --style raw --chaos 30 [rootedness]","style":"Modern minimalism with historical nods","overlay_opacity":20,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#EDE4D9","#9B643D","#1D1D1D"],"font_primary":"BluuNext-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#1D1D1D","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Change is Necessary but Unsettling","section_body":"Human beings often resist change despite recognizing its necessity.
