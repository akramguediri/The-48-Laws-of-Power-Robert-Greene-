Instead of taking responsibility for mistakes, successful leaders utilize scapegoats to deflect blame and create an impression of flawless leadership. The chapter details historical examples, including Ts'ao Ts'ao and Cesare Borgia, who strategically employed scapegoats to evade accountability. This manipulation showcases the duality of power dynamics, allowing leaders to operate behind the scenes while preserving their reputations. Ultimately, Greene illustrates that power is about appearances and influence, not necessarily direct actions.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"Scapegoat figuratively illustrated, Atmospheric surreal environment with tension, High-contrast or unnatural lighting, Dark and disruptive color palette, Emotionally charged mood or duality, Avant-garde or surrealist art style, Medium with visceral or textured feel, Unsettling or dramatic composition, Hyper-detailed surface or symbolic texture, Specific lens or camera angle for tension --v 7 --style raw --chaos 30 [revelation]","style":"Dark and dramatic, highlighting manipulation and power dynamics","overlay_opacity":30,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#F8F5F2","#3B3A3F","#1D1D1D"],"font_primary":"BluuNext-Bold.otf","font_secondary":"CabinetGrotesk-Regular.otf","text_color":"#3B3A3F","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"Appearances Matter Most in Power","section_body":"In the world of power, maintaining a pristine reputation is crucial.
