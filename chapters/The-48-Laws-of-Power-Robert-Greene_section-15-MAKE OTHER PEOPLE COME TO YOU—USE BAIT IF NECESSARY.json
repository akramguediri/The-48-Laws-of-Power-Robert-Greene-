Through historical examples like Napoleon and Talleyrand, it illustrates the art of luring others into traps that exploit their weaknesses. By creating an enticing bait, one can dictate the terms of engagement, ensuring that enemies tire themselves while you maintain your energy. This method not only establishes a power imbalance but also allows for strategic manipulation without overt confrontation.
